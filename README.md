## features

### hands free code generation

No more touching files and creating scripts from scratch!  
Hands free code generation takes care of boilerplate code and command routing so you don't have to!

### easy install

Get started in seconds!  
Want to install without using quickstart? No problem! Use the install script!

---

## quickstart

Run the script below and give it a name. That's it.

```
{
  (
    clone-sh2() {
      test "${SH2}" || {
        clone sh2 
        echo -e "\ndeclare -x SH2='$( realpath sh2 )'" >> ~/.bashrc 
      }
    }
    clone() {
      git clone https://github.com/temptemp3/${1}.git ${2:-${1}}
    }
    prompt-name() {
      read -p "What's Me's name? (niceboy) " name
    }
    get-name() {
      while [ ! "${name}" ]
      do
       prompt-name
      done
    }
    exit-on-duplicate-name() {
      test ! -d "${name}" || { 
        echo "Someone else has Me's name!" 
        exit 
      }
    }
    install() {
      echo -e "\n${name}() { bash '$( realpath clipboy.sh )' \${@} ; }" >> ~/.bashrc
    }
    fix-permissions() {
      find . -type f -name \*.sh | xargs chmod u+x
    }
    if-darwin() {
      test ! "$( uname )" = "Darwin" || {
        which dos2unix &>/dev/null || {
          brew install dos2unix
        }
        {
          find ${name} -type f -name \*.sh \
          | xargs dos2unix
        }
      }
    }
    name=""
    get-name
    exit-on-duplicate-name
    echo "Me's name is ${name}!"
    clone beard.sh ${name}
    (
      cd ${name}
      clone-sh2
      fix-permissions
      install
    )
    if-darwin
    source ~/.bashrc
  )

## usage

Suppose that we complete the quickstart and end up calling our beard bob. Here follows all the things bob can do out of the box.

### commands

It can run any command you have done in the commands directory.

`bob command`

Specifying only the command as above forces the default sub command to run.

Each command comes with a base set of sub commands, one of which is help. 

`bob command:help`

By default, help lists the sub commands available.

The command `command` is not included out of the box.

### install

```bash
cd /path/to/install
bash clipboy.sh install
```

### make

It comes with a builtin command to make things including lemonade if you are unfamiliar with its sub commands.

#### functions

`bob make:function test`

By default, in the case of test, bob will create a directory called test.sh with script called test.sh. However, you may want bob to just create a bash script without a directory. In that case, we would added the --single long option as follows.

`bob make:function test --single`

Optional, you may also provide the --dated option to instruct it to prefix the filename with a date string, that is, yymmdd.

`bob make:function test --single --dated`

make:function helpful when you need to need a point to start writing a new bash script. However, it may be used to extend it, there is a sub command more helpful call command.

#### commands

`bob make:command new-command`

#### scripts

`bob make:script new-script`

#### subcommands

`bob make:subcommand new-command-extension`

Running `make:subcommand` after `make:script` using the same argument links the subcommand to the script. This way we are able to isolate code that actually does something in the scripts directory.

### store

`bob store:subcommand args`

#### get

`bob store:get tel`

```
bob store:get tel
123456789
```

#### set

`bob store:set tel 123456789`

```
bob store:set tel 123456789

```

#### list

`bob store:list`

```
$ bob store:list 
tel: 123456789
fax: 123456780
```
